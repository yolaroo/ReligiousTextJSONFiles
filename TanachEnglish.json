              "Get you, from each one of your tribes, wise men, and understanding, and full of knowledge, and I will make them heads over you.'",
              "And you answered me, and said: 'The thing which you hast spoken is good for us to do.'",
              "So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and full of knowledge, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, tribe by tribe.",
              "And I charged your judges at that time, saying: 'Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.",
              "Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike; you shall not be afraid of the face of any man; for the judgment is God's; and the cause that is too hard for you you shall bring unto me, and I will hear it.'",

              "And I said unto you: 'You are come unto the hill-country of the Amorites, which the Lord our God gives unto us.",

              "And you came near unto me every one of you, and said: 'Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us back word of the way by which we must go up, and the cities unto which we shall come.'",
              "And the thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe;",

              "And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us back word, and said: 'Good is the land which the Lord our God gives unto us.'",
              "Yet you would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God;",
              "and you murmured in your tents, and said: 'Because the Lord hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.",
              "Whither are we going up? our brethren have made our heart to melt, saying: The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.'",

              "Then you answered and said unto me: 'We have sinned against the Lord, we will go up and fight, according to all that the Lord our God commanded us.' And you girded on every man his weapons of war, and deemed it a light thing to go up into the hill-country.",
              "And the Lord said unto me: 'Say unto them: Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; unless you be smitten before your enemies.'",
              "So I spoke unto you, and you hearkened not; but you rebelled against the commandment of the Lord, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country.",

              "And you returned and wept before the Lord; but the Lord hearkened not to your voice, nor gave ear unto you.",

              "So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons; they brought the vessels to her, and she poured out.",
              "And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son: 'Bring me yet a vessel.' And he said unto her: 'There is not a vessel more.' And the oil stayed.",
              "Then she came and told the man of God. And he said: 'Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt, and live you and your sons of the rest.'",
              "And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.",
              "And she said unto her husband: 'Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passes by us continually.",
              "Let us make, I pray you, a little chamber on the roof; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick; and it shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in thither.'",
              "And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the upper chamber and lay there.",
              "And he said to Gehazi his servant: 'Call this Shunammite.' And when he had called her, she stood before him.",
              "And he said unto him: 'Say now unto her: Behold, you hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? would you be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host?' And she answered: 'I dwell among mine own people.'",
              "And he said: 'What then is to be done for her?' And Gehazi answered: 'Verily she hath no son, and her husband is old.'",
              "And he said: 'Call her.' And when he had called her, she stood in the door.",
              "And he said: 'At this season, when the time comes round, you shalt embrace a son.' And she said: 'Nay, my Lord, you man of God, do not lie unto your handmaid.'",
              "And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said unto her.",
              "And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.",
              "And he said unto his father: 'My head, my head.' And he said to his servant: 'Carry him to his mother.'",
              "And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.",
              "And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.",
              "And she called unto her husband, and said: 'Send me, I pray you, one of the servants, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come back.'",
              "And he said: Wherefore wilt you go to him today? it is neither new moon nor sabbath.' And she said: 'It shall be well.'",
              "Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant: 'Drive, and go forward; slacken me not the riding, except I bid you. '",
              "So she went, and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant: 'Behold, yonder is that Shunammite.",
              "Run, I pray you, now to meet her, and say unto her: Is it well with thee? is it well with your husband? is it well with the child?' And she answered: 'It is well.'",
              "And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said: 'Let her alone; for her soul is bitter within her; and the Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not told Me.'",
              "Then she said: 'Did I desire a son of my Lord? did I not say: Do not deceive me?'",
              "Then he said to Gehazi: 'Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go your way; if you meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute you, answer him not; and lay my staff upon the face of the child.'",
              "And the mother of the child said: 'As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. ' And he arose, and followed her.",
              "And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying: 'The child is not awoke.'",
              "And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.",
              "He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the Lord.",
              "And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands; and he stretched himself upon him; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.",
              "Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him; and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.",
              "And he called Gehazi, and said: 'Call this Shunammite.' So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said: 'Take up your son.'",
              "Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed down to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.",
              "And Elisha came again to Gilgal; and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said unto his servant: 'Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.'",
              "And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage; for they knew them not.",
              "So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said: 'O man of God, there is death in the pot.' And they could not eat thereof.",
              "But he said: 'Then bring meal.' And he cast it into the pot; and he said: 'Pour out for the people, that they may eat.' And there was no harm in the pot.",
              "And there came a man from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of corn in his sack. And he said: 'Give unto the people, that they may eat.'",
              "And his servant said: 'How should I set this before a hundred men?' But he said: 'Give the people, that they may eat; for thus saith the Lord: They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.'",
              "So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the Lord."

              "Are not Amanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean?' So he turned, and went away in a rage.",

              "In this thing the Lord pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I prostrate myself in the house of Rimmon, when I prostrate myself in the house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon your servant in this thing.'",

              "And Naaman said: 'Be content, take two talents.' And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bore them before him.",

              "I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.",
              "I beheld Till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was as white snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, and the wheels thereof burning fire.",
              "A fiery stream issued And came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; The judgment was set, and the books were opened.",

              "and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell; even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose appearance was greater than that of its fellows.",
              "I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;",
              "until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High; and the time came, and the saints possessed the kingdom.",
              "Thus he said: 'The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.",
              "And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise; and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.",
              "And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the seasons and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.",
              "But the judgment shall sit, and his dominions shall be taken away, to be consumed and to be destroy unto the end.",
              "And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; their kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey them.'",
              "Here is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts much scared me, and my countenance was changed in me; but I kept the matter in my heart."

              "So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying: 'You children of Israel, turn back unto the Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may return to the remnant that are escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.",

              "For there were many in the congregation that had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had the charge of killing the passover lambs for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the Lord.",
              "For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it is written. For hezekiah had prayed for them, saying: 'The good Lord pardon",
              "every one that sets his heart to seek God, the Lord, the God of his fathers, though [he be] not [cleansed] according to the purification that pertains to holy things.'",
              "And the Lord hearkened to hezekiah, and healed the people.",
              "And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the Lord.",
              "And hezekiah spoke encouragingly unto all the Levites that were well skilled in the service of the Lord. So they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and giving thanks to the Lord, the God of their fathers.",
              "And the whole congregation took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept other seven days with gladness.",
              "For hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep; and priests sanctified themselves in great numbers.",
              "And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.",
              "So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.",
              "Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people; and their voice was heard [of the Lord], and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even unto heaven."
